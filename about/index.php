	<h1>About me</h1>

	<p>Born and raised in Minnesota just south of the Twin Cities, I've been a huge Minnesota sports fan for as long as I can remember. ..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</p>

	<h1>About the site</h1>

	<p>Around the year 2010, a few years after I became more serious about collecting, I was looking for a way to better display my collection digitally. I thought it would be great to be able to look through my cards without having to physically hold them in hand. So, I began the huge undertaking of scanning every card I owned, uploading the pictures of my computer, cropping and resizing them, and placing them in a series of folders to organize them by year, set, and subset. This was a massive time consumer, but it would prove a critical first step to the creation of this website, even if I wouldn't know it yet. The results were great, but progress was pain-stakingly slow. I had thousands of Twins cards I wanted to get a record of digitally, so you can imagine the time it would take to even make a small dent in my collection. Plus, I was still continuing to buy and trade for new cards to add to my collection. In fact, I still am not fully caught up with getting scans of everything, and I'm expecting it to be several years before I'm truly finished and only need to worry about taking care of new cards I get.</p>

	<p>While this process was very slow, it was unavoidable, and I did enjoy the results. It was nice to not have to page though a binder to see if I had a certain card and instead be able to look at more and more of my cards on my laptop. That said, it wasn't the perfect solution. After a few years of working on scanning cards in my free time, I realized there were two things missing that I wanted to have. First, it was great to be able to look at my cards digitally, but I only had copies of everything on my laptop- If I was at a card shop or show and wanted to check and see if I had a certain card, I wouldn't be able to look at pictures of my collection to see. Second, I wanted to be able to share my collection with the sports cards forums I frequent online. I really enjoy the hobby, but it's a lot of fun to be able to share the growth of your collection with the friends you make online. The solution I found for this was Dropbox. I would still be able to have pictures of everything on my laptop, but now I could pull up Dropbox on my phone if I didn't have access to my laptop, and I could share a link to my account with the forums so they could look through my cards. This was another step forward, but still wasn't perfect. It accomplished the basics (having pictures of my cards in a fairly organized manner), but still wasn't exactly what I wanted, missing things like a nicer layout and easier access, advanced searching, sorting, and filtering, and so on. But, it was good enough for awhile.</p>

	<p>Finally, in late 2016, I decided I was going to start building my own site. This was something I had been thinking about doing for awhile, but never got around to for several reasons. It felt like the right time to start. I finally had enough of my collection scanned in for a site to actually be worthwhile, and I was nearing the completion of my Computer Science degree and had learned enough to feel comfortable with tackling this project. So, I got underway, building a database to store information about my cards, creating a form to write information to this database, finding a good way to display cards to visitors to the site, and so on. If you're interested in hearing more of the specifics regarding how I did this, what tools and languages I used, and so on, please contact me and I'd love to share some more details. Without getting too specific, my site revolves around a MySQL database that holds information about my cards, and I use PHP all over to interact with the database. Anyways, the development continued through all of 2017 until late that year when I was finally getting to a point of being happy enough with what I've made to buy a domain name and share a link publically. It was by no means a completely finished product at that time, but I got to a point where things were, in my opinion, clean enough to share with the world and enough had been completed where I could give people something to look at while still being able to work on things behind the scenes.</p>

	<p>Today, I'm constantly working on polishing things created in the past and implementing new features for the future. I still have a long ways to go until I would even begin to consider this project as complete, but that's part of the fun of it. Again, if you'd like to know more about how the site works, feel free to give me a holler. It's been a fun project and a great learning experience for me. Thanks for reading about it!</p>
