	<h1>Chris Herrmann PC</h1>
	<p>This page holds my wantlists and havelists for my Chris Herrmann PC. I started collecting Chris in 2013 after watching him play with the Twins and liking how he played the game, despite not receiving a lot of consistent playing time. At that point in my collecting career, I also was looking for a player that I could build an extensive PC of. Chris only had around 40 different cards at this point, so I figured this would be a good guy to start with. So, I decided to go all out and track down as many copies of each card of his that I could find! Unfortunately for me, Chris was traded from the Twins to the Diamondbacks in 2015. While I still go after his Dbacks cards to try and keep a true player PC going, I've limited myself to just one copy of those cards. That said, I do still try and acquire as many copies of each of his Twins cards as possible. So, if you have a card of Herrmann that isn't listed under my wants, but it's one of his Twins cards, I'd still love to work out a deal for it!</p>

	<h1>Wantlist (non 1/1s)</h1>

	<p>Here I have listed each Herrmann card that I don't already have a copy of. Only non 1/1s are listed in this section to help keep things a bit cleaner. If you happen to have any of these, please let me know! Also, remember that I'd like your Herrmann Twins cards even if they aren't on this list!</p>

	<h1>Wantlist (1/1s)</h1>

	<p>Here is the list of the Chris Herrmann 1/1s that I have not tracked down. Obviously, if you have one of these, that means I don't, and I'd like to get it from you! Additionally, if you have any information of where I may be able to find any of these 1/1s, please let me know.</p>

	<h1>Havelist</h1>

	<p>Below is a list of all cards I have of Chris Herrmann. Again, I am interested in trading for doubles (triples, x4, etc :) ) of Twins cards, but I like to keep a list of what all I have in addition to what all I need- It just helps me be a bit more accurate with my lists. I'm currently working on a page where you can view all of these cards, so stay tuned for that! For now, feel free to take a look at the Herrmann cards I've acquired so far:</p>
