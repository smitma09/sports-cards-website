/* Look at .navbar-fixed-top in bootstrap.css to see what's being styled
     Move those rules to this file so can stop using bootstrap.css
     Removing bootstrap.css from style rules keeps logo alright but messes up the li elements of the actual nav
     Will likely have to find style rules for li elements, positioning rules, maybe background color
     Once everything is in the correct spot, can make those dropdowns appear on hover
