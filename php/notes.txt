Update 1/5 (late night)
-Adding to database seems to be working, OTHER THAN serialFirst and serialLast
	-Works when set and inserting integers, but not when trying to insert null
	-Make 2 separate sql statements, one if numbering is true which includes both fields, one excluding serialfirst/last if not numbered?
-Will have to clear information from twins_pc table after dont thoroughly testing

Update 1/5
-Getting pretty close to writing to database from addCard.php
-Think there's errors in checkboxes that are unchecked
	-Go thru each and set them. i.e.
		-if $numbered
			$numberedDB = ___ (1 works i think)
		else
			$numberedDB = ___ (0 i think)
	-Need to find what they are supposed to be set to

	-Would be much more efficient to change all tinyint fields to bit fields
		BIT(1)
		Set to 1 (true) or 0 (false)

Update 1/2
-Need to reorganize addCard.php
	-Only do anything if the password is correct- Move that if statement up to the top
-Image data working, can upload an image and get it stored correctly, then take the path and display it in plain html
-Todo
	-Figure out database side of things: Have infomation stored in the database when form is submitted

Notes as of 1/1/17

-Successfully figured out how to upload images
-Successfully figured out how to password protect form-entering actions
        -(Only do stuff with the form data if the password was correct)

-Todo
        -Figure out how to enter cards to database on form submission
        -Add in file picker to form to handle images
                -Add image storage from upload.php to addCard.php
                        -(So images are stored correctly)
                -Manipulate form data so that the image is put in the correct place
                        -2010 Topps Gold Justin Morneau 10 should be stored in .../twins_pc/2010/Topps/Gold/10_Justin_Morneau.jpg
                                -(Or something similar)

                                        -Above 2 bullet points idea for storing Morneau golds 0789/2010 and 1234/2010
                                -Graded cards in file path?
                                        -.../2010/Topps/Gold/10_Justin_Morenau_1234_2010_BGS_95.jpg
                                                -A grade of 9.5 would case issues
                                                -Strip grade of periods
                                                        -Other instances of avoiding periods, slashes, etc?
                                -Biggest issue: How to handle 2 of the same card
                                        -Think including serial numbers is the way to go
                                        -Grading info probably not necessary to include
                                                -Will be able to see it's graded from rest of card info
                                                -Path is just how to get to the image, maybe no need to make it so detailed
                                -How to handle empty fields
                                        -Need to make 2010 Topps Gold into .../2010/Topps/Gold/...
                                        -Need to make sure 2010 Topps doesn't become .../2010/Topps//...
                                                -Double slash would cause issues
                                        -Idea: Use PHP ifs and variables: $subset = "Gold/" or $subset = ""
                                                -Empty string wouldn't add an unnecessary slash and mess things up
                                                -Use ifs- If data is set, make it "data/", otherwise make it ""
		-Summary of everything above: Replace text path to picture field with file picker and
			code the correct path to where the image will be saved (string manipulation?)
        -Finalize form fields
                -Consider adding:
                        -SP
                        -VAR
                -How to handle cards with multiple players?

_____Order_____
1. Finalize form fields/handle multi-player cards
        -(Consider other weird situations too)
2. Play with image file path, make sure it's going to something that makes sense COMPLETED
	-(1 and 2 can be done in either order, but must be done before 3)
3. Enter form data to database on form submission
4. Put it all together
5. Have fun entering cards
6. Figure out how to combine getting info from the database (PHP(?)) with showing the images (HTML- check Bootstrap too)
